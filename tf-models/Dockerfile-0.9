# This dockerfile downloads ImageNet to ${DATA_DIR}/imagenet
# 
# * Set IMAGENET_USERNAME and IMAGENET_ACCESS_KEY
# * Mount a 500GB+ file system on ${DATA_DIR}
# * Launch and wait
# 
# It can also be used to train the model. In this context, 
# it assumes being run on Kubernetes therefore
#  * takes CLUSTER_CONF as an ENV, set by k8s via configMap
#  * takes POD_NAME as entry to evaluate its role and task id via POD_NAME=<job name>-<task id>
# 
# Note: this is hugely inspired from Google's Tensorflow Worshop
